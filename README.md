# Distributed System for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data ---- Sagar Garg

## Project Description

With the use of many programming techniques, including thread programming, thread APIs, MPI programming, task programming, big data analytics, and MapReduce, this project attempts to create a distributed system for sentiment analysis of social media data. analytics, and MapReduce.

## Project Deliverables

1. How the project will be implemented: The system will be created utilising the Python programming language and the aforementioned programming ideas.

2. Project code and related files: You can obtain the project code and related files on GitHub by using the link provided in the project guidelines.

## Steps to Develop the Project

1. Identify the problem and break it down into smaller, more manageable sections. Using the ideas you acquired in previous weeks, define the problem that you wish to address.

2. Decide on a programming language: Python will be used for this project.

3. Create the application architecture: Lay out the architecture of the application, including how its various elements will communicate with one another.

4. Implement thread programming: To allow for concurrent task execution within the application, implement thread programming techniques.

5. Introduce thread APIs: Include thread APIs in the programme to give thread execution more synchronisation and control.

6. Use MPI programming: In a distributed computing environment, MPI programming enables message forwarding between several threads and nodes.

7. Implement task programming techniques : To make it possible to divide a bigger task into more manageable, independent subtasks that can be completed in parallel.

8. Integrate big data analytics: To facilitate the processing and analysis of enormous datasets, incorporate big data analytics concepts into the application.

9. Implement MapReduce: To handle huge datasets concurrently across distributed computing nodes, implement the MapReduce programming model.

10. Thoroughly test and debug the application: Do this to make sure it functions as planned and to find and correct any faults or problems.
