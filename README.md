# Distributed System for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data

## Project Description

This project aims to build a distributed system for sentiment analysis of social media data using various programming concepts such as thread programming, thread APIs, MPI programming, task programming, big data analytics, and MapReduce.

## Project Deliverables

1. Implementation of the proposed project: The system will be developed using Python programming language with the aforementioned programming concepts.

2. Code and related files: The project code and related files will be available on GitHub, and can be accessed through the link shared in the project guidelines.

## Steps to Develop the Project

1. Define the problem: Identify the problem that you want to solve using the concepts learned in previous weeks, and break it down into smaller, more manageable parts.

2. Choose a programming language: Python programming language will be used for this project.

3. Design the application architecture: Plan out the application architecture, including how the various components will interact with each other.

4. Implement the thread programming: Implement thread programming concepts to enable concurrent execution of tasks within the application.

5. Implement thread APIs: Incorporate thread APIs into the application to provide additional control and synchronization over thread execution.

6. Implement MPI programming: Use MPI programming to enable message passing between different threads and nodes in a distributed computing environment.

7. Implement task programming: Implement task programming concepts to enable the division of a larger task into smaller, independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel.

8. Incorporate big data analytics: Integrate big data analytics concepts into the application to enable the processing and analysis of large datasets.

9. Implement MapReduce: Implement the MapReduce programming model to process large datasets in parallel across distributed computing nodes.

10. Test and debug the application: Thoroughly test and debug the application to ensure that it works as intended and identify and fix any errors or issues.

11. Deploy the application: Once testing is complete, deploy the application on a cloud platform to make it accessible to users.
